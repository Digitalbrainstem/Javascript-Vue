# Javascript Vue Language Support #

Syntax highlighting for Javascript Vue files.

This provides vue syntax inside template fields. Templates no longer look like strings!

If there is anything that I missed or features you would like this to include. [Let me know](https://github.com/Digitalbrainstem/javascript-vue/issues)

*NOTE: This is in early development; though, I do not see any issues so far. If you find some, report them!*
